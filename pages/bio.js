                    text="Lars Hoogland (1998) is an upcoming jazz bassist from the Netherlands. Lars finds his inspiration in legendary bassists such as Milt Hinton and Ron Carter.

<br><br>
In 2021, Lars released the album <i>Yagan</i> alongside fellow musicians Kris Ransijn and Luuk Withagen. Inspired by Wayne Shorter and the second Miles Davis Quintet, <i>Yagan</i> is heavily rooted in post-bop traditions, while also incorporating musical elements from all around the world, ranging from Tibetan folk music to Chilean rhythms.
<br><br>
Today, Lars is making his mark on the music scene as a reliable musician that provides a strong foundation for his peers, while leaving space for improvisation and interaction.
<br><br>
During his time as the bassist for blues band Harlem Lake, Lars travelled to Memphis, Tennessee where he and his band performed as a featured artist in the 2019 International Blues Challenge.
<br><br>
    Afterwards, Lars enrolled in the Conservatory of Rotterdam (Codarts), where he studied both bass guitar and upright bass with teachers including Frans van Geest, Alessandro Fongaro, Marius Beets and Stefan Lievestro.
        <br><br>
            Lars has shared the stage or the studio with musicians such as John Helliwell, Benjamin Herman, EfraÃ¯m Trujillo, Bart Wirtz, Andy Scott, Nils van Haften, and others.
